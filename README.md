Technical Implementation
Mock Blockchain Integration: Demonstrates conceptual blockchain interaction

Illustrative Encryption: Uses basic ciphers for demonstration purposes (not production-grade)

Local Storage: Session-based data persistence

Transaction Monitoring: Real-time status tracking

Getting Started
Login using your email credentials

Connect your wallet for decentralized identity

Send messages with automatic encryption and blockchain logging

Verify messages using the integrity checker

Monitor activity through the analytics dashboard

Security Notes
⚠️ Important: The encryption shown in this demonstration (Caesar cipher) is for illustrative purposes only and NOT SECURE. This is a conceptual demonstration using mocked blockchain interactions.

Future Enhancements
Real blockchain integration

Production-grade encryption

Expanded analytics capabilities

Multi-chain support
